#Description

Control Bisby with arrow keys, hjkl, or number pad.
You can clear levels in two different ways:  

- Collect all the yellow energy units and open the yellow gate.
- Crush enemies with crates, collect their blue datachips, and open the blue gate.

Guide Bisby safely through 7 levels to reach the surface.

#Tips

- You can push crates from the sides, even through dirt.
- Even dangerous crates have uses.
- It's turn-based. Enemies only move after you move. Take your time!
